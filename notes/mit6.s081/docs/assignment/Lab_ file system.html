<h1>Lab: file system</h1>

<p>In this lab you will add large files and symbolic links to the xv6
  file system.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before writing code, you should read "Chapter 8:
  File system" from the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6
  book</a> and study the corresponding code.
</div>

<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>util</tt> branch:

<pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout fs</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
</pre>


<h2>Large files <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an xv6
file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks, or 268*BSIZE
bytes (BSIZE is 1024 in xv6). This limit comes from the fact that an
xv6 inode contains 12 "direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect"
block number, which refers to a block that holds up to 256 more block
  numbers, for a total of 12+256=268 blocks.

<p>The <tt>bigfile</tt> command creates the longest file it can,
and reports that size:
<pre>
$ bigfile
..
wrote 268 blocks
bigfile: file is too small
$
</pre>
The test fails because <tt>bigfile</tt> expects to be able
to create a file with 65803 blocks, but unmodified xv6 limits
files to 268 blocks.

<p>You'll change the xv6 file system code to support a
"doubly-indirect" block in each inode, containing 256 addresses of
singly-indirect blocks, each of which can contain up to 256 addresses
of data blocks. The result will be that a file will be able to consist
of up to 65803 blocks, or 256*256+256+11 blocks (11 instead of 12, because we will
sacrifice one of the direct block numbers for the double-indirect
block).

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

The <tt>mkfs</tt> program creates the xv6 file system disk image
and determines
how many total blocks the file system has; this size is controlled by
<tt>FSSIZE</tt> in <tt>kernel/param.h</tt>.
You'll see that <tt>FSSIZE</tt> in the repository for
this lab is set to
200,000 blocks.  You should see the following output from <tt>mkfs/mkfs</tt>
in the make output:
<pre>
nmeta 70 (boot, super, log blocks 30 inode blocks 13, bitmap blocks 25) blocks 199930 total 200000
</pre>
This line describes the file system that <tt>mkfs/mkfs</tt> built: it
has 70 meta-data blocks (blocks used to describe the file system) and
199,930 data blocks, totaling 200,000 blocks.
<br>
If at any point during the lab you find yourself having to rebuild the file system from scratch, you
can run <tt>make clean</tt> which forces make to rebuild fs.img.

<h3>What to Look At</h3>

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by <tt>struct dinode</tt>
in <tt>fs.h</tt>. You're particularly interested in <tt>NDIRECT</tt>,
<tt>NINDIRECT</tt>, <tt>MAXFILE</tt>, and the <tt>addrs[]</tt> element
of <tt>struct dinode</tt>. Look at Figure 8.3 in the xv6 text for a
diagram of the standard xv6 inode.

<p>
The code that finds a file's data on disk is in <tt>bmap()</tt>
in <tt>fs.c</tt>. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. <tt>bmap()</tt> is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, <tt>bmap()</tt> allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

<p>
<tt>bmap()</tt> deals with two kinds of block numbers. The <tt>bn</tt>
argument is a "logical block number" -- a block number within the file,
relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, and the
argument to <tt>bread()</tt>, are disk block numbers.
You can view <tt>bmap()</tt> as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

<h3>Your Job</h3>

<div class="required">
Modify <tt>bmap()</tt> so that it implements a doubly-indirect block,
in addition to direct blocks and a singly-indirect block.  You'll have
to have only 11 direct blocks, rather than 12, to make room for your
new doubly-indirect block; you're not allowed to change the size of an
on-disk inode.  The first 11 elements of <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt> should
be direct blocks; the 12th should be a singly-indirect block (just
like the current one); the 13th should be your new doubly-indirect
block. You are done with this exercise when <tt>bigfile</tt> writes
65803 blocks and <tt>usertests</tt> runs successfully:
</div>

<pre>
$ <kbd>bigfile</kbd>
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 65803 blocks
done; ok
$ usertests
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
</pre>

<p>
<tt>bigfile</tt> will take at least a minute and a half to run.

<p>Hints:

<ul>
    
<li> Make sure you understand <tt>bmap()</tt>. Write out a diagram of the
relationships between <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, the indirect block, the
doubly-indirect block and the singly-indirect blocks it points to, and
data blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a doubly-indirect
block increases the maximum file size by 256*256 blocks (really -1,
since you have to decrease the number of direct blocks by one).

<li>
Think about how you'll index the doubly-indirect block, and
the indirect blocks it points to, with the logical block
number.

<li>If you change the definition of <tt>NDIRECT</tt>, you'll
probably have to change the declaration of <tt>addrs[]</tt>
in <tt>struct inode</tt> in <tt>file.h</tt>. Make sure that
<tt>struct inode</tt> and <tt>struct dinode</tt> have the
same number of elements in their <tt>addrs[]</tt> arrays.

<li>If you change the definition of <tt>NDIRECT</tt>, make sure to create a
new <tt>fs.img</tt>, since <tt>mkfs</tt> uses <tt>NDIRECT</tt> to build the
file system.  

<li>If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps by crashing,
delete <tt>fs.img</tt> (do this from Unix, not xv6).  <tt>make</tt> will build a
new clean file system image for you.

<li>Don't forget to <tt>brelse()</tt> each block that you
<tt>bread()</tt>.

<li>You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
  blocks only as needed, like the original <tt>bmap()</tt>.

<li>Make sure <tt>itrunc</tt> frees all blocks of a file, including
  double-indirect blocks.

</ul>


<h2>Symbolic links <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this exercise you will add symbolic links to xv6.  Symbolic
links (or soft links) refer to a linked file by pathname; when a
symbolic link is opened, the kernel follows the link to the referred
file.  Symbolic links resembles hard links, but hard links are
restricted to pointing to file on the same disk, while symbolic links
can cross disk devices.  Although xv6 doesn't support multiple
devices, implementing this system call is a good exercise to
understand how pathname lookup works.

<h3>Your job</h3>

<div class="required">
<p>You will implement the <tt>symlink(char *target, char *path)</tt>
system call, which creates a new symbolic link at path that refers
to file named by target. For further information, see the man page
symlink.  To test, add symlinktest to the Makefile and run it. Your
solution is complete when the tests produce the following output
(including usertests succeeding).
</div>

<pre>
$ <kbd>symlinktest</kbd>
Start: test symlinks
test symlinks: ok
Start: test concurrent symlinks
test concurrent symlinks: ok
$ usertests
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
</pre>
 
<p>Hints:

<ul>

<li> First, create a new system call number for symlink, add an entry
to user/usys.pl, user/user.h, and implement an empty sys_symlink in kernel/sysfile.c.

<li>Add a new file type (<tt>T_SYMLINK</tt>) to kernel/stat.h to
represent a symbolic link.

<li> Add a new flag to kernel/fcntl.h, (<tt>O_NOFOLLOW</tt>), that can
be used with the <tt>open</tt> system call. Note that flags passed to
<tt>open</tt> are combined using a bitwise OR operator, so your new
flag should not overlap with any existing flags. This will let you
compile user/symlinktest.c once you add it to the Makefile.

<li>Implement the <tt>symlink(target, path)</tt> system call to create
a new symbolic link at path that refers to target. Note that target
does not need to exist for the system call to succeed. You will need
to choose somewhere to store the target path of a symbolic link, for
example, in the inode's data blocks. <tt>symlink</tt> should return an integer
representing success (0) or failure (-1) similar to <tt>link</tt> and <tt>unlink</tt>.

<li>Modify the <tt>open</tt> system call to handle the case where the path
refers to a symbolic link. If the file does not exist, <tt>open</tt>
must fail.  When a process specifies <tt>O_NOFOLLOW</tt> in the flags
to <tt>open</tt>, <tt>open</tt> should open the symlink (and not
follow the symbolic link).

<li>If the linked file is also a symbolic link, you must recursively
follow it until a non-link file is reached. If the links form a cycle,
you must return an error code. You may approximate this by returning
an error code if the depth of links reaches some threshold (e.g., 10).

<li> Other system calls (e.g., link and unlink) must not
  follow symbolic links; these system calls operate on the symbolic
  link itself.

<li>You do not have to handle symbolic links to directories for this
lab.

</ul>

to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
