<h1>Lab: Multithreading</h1>

<p>This lab will familiarize you with multithreading.  You will
implement switching between threads in a user-level threads package,
use multiple threads to speed up a program, and implement a barrier.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before writing code, you should make sure you have read "Chapter 7: Scheduling" from
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a> and studied
  the corresponding code.
</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the thread branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout thread</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>


<h2>Uthread: switching between threads <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this exercise you will design the context switch mechanism for a
  user-level threading system, and then implement it.  To get you
  started, your xv6 has two files user/uthread.c and
  user/uthread_switch.S, and a rule in the Makefile to build a uthread
  program.  uthread.c contains most of a user-level threading package,
  and code for three simple test threads.
  The threading package is missing some of the code to create a thread and to switch
  between threads.

  <div class="required">
<p>
Your job is to come up with a plan to create threads and save/restore
registers to switch between threads, and implement that plan.
When you're done,
<tt>make grade</tt> should say that your solution passes the
<tt>uthread</tt> test.
</div>

Once you've finished, you should see the following output when you
run <tt>uthread</tt> on xv6 (the three threads might start in
a different order):

<pre>
$ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
...
$ <kbd>uthread</kbd>
thread_a started
thread_b started
thread_c started
thread_c 0
thread_a 0
thread_b 0
thread_c 1
thread_a 1
thread_b 1
...
thread_c 99
thread_a 99
thread_b 99
thread_c: exit after 100
thread_a: exit after 100
thread_b: exit after 100
thread_schedule: no runnable threads
$
</pre>

<p>
This output comes from the three test threads, each of which has
a loop that prints a line and then yields the CPU to the
other threads.
<p>

<p>
At this point, however, with no context switch code, you'll see
no output.
<p>

<p>You will need to add code to <tt>thread_create()</tt> and
   <tt>thread_schedule()</tt> in <tt>user/uthread.c</tt>,
   and <tt>thread_switch</tt> in <tt>user/uthread_switch.S</tt>.
   One goal is ensure that when <tt>thread_schedule()</tt> runs a given
   thread for the first time, the thread executes
   the function passed to <tt>thread_create()</tt>, on its own stack.
   Another goal is to ensure that <tt>thread_switch</tt> saves
   the registers of the thread being switched away from, restores the registers
   of the thread being switched to, and returns to the point in the
   latter thread's instructions where it last left off.
   You will
  have to decide where to save/restore registers; modifying
  <tt>struct thread</tt> to hold registers is a good plan.
  You'll need to add a call to <tt>thread_switch</tt> in <tt>thread_schedule</tt>;
  you can pass whatever arguments you need to <tt>thread_switch</tt>,
  but the intent is to switch from thread <tt>t</tt> to
  <tt>next_thread</tt>.

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li> <tt>thread_switch</tt> needs to save/restore only
the callee-save registers. Why?
    <li> You can see the assembly code for uthread in user/uthread.asm, which
may be handy for debugging.
<li>To test your code it might be helpful to single step through your
<tt>thread_switch</tt> using <tt>riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb</tt>.  You can
get started in this way:

<pre>
(gdb) file user/_uthread
Reading symbols from user/_uthread...
(gdb) b uthread.c:60

</pre>

<p>This sets a breakpoint at line 60 of <tt>uthread.c</tt>.
The breakpoint may (or may not) be triggered before you even run
<tt>uthread</tt>. How could that happen?

<p>Once your xv6 shell runs, type "uthread", and gdb will break at line 60.
Now you can type commands like the following to inspect
the state of <tt>uthread</tt>:

<pre>
  (gdb) p/x *next_thread
</pre>

With "x", you can examine the content of a memory location:
<pre>
  (gdb) x/x next_thread->stack
</pre>

<p>You can skip to the start of <tt>thread_switch</tt> thus:
<pre>
   (gdb) b thread_switch
   (gdb) c
</pre>

<p>You can single step assembly instructions using:
<pre>
   (gdb) si
</pre>

<p>On-line documentation for gdb is <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">here</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Using threads  <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this assignment you will explore parallel programming with
threads and locks using a hash table. You should do this assignment on
a real Linux or MacOS computer (not xv6, not qemu) that has multiple
cores. Most recent laptops have multicore processors.

<p>
This assignment uses the UNIX <tt>pthread</tt> threading library.
You can find information about it from the manual page, with
<tt>man pthreads</tt>, and you can look on the web, for example
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_mutex_lock.html">here</a>,
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_mutex_init.html">here</a>,
and
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_create.html">here</a>.

<p>The file <tt>notxv6/ph.c</tt> contains a simple hash table that
is correct if used from a single thread, but incorrect when used from
multiple threads.
In your main xv6 directory (perhaps <tt>~/xv6-labs-2020</tt>),
type this:
<pre>
$ make ph
$ ./ph 1
</pre>
Note that to build <tt>ph</tt> the Makefile uses your OS's gcc, not
the 6.S081 tools.
The argument to <tt>ph</tt> specifies the number of threads that
execute put and get operations on the the hash table.
After running for a little while, <tt>ph 1</tt> will produce output similar
to this:

<pre>
100000 puts, 3.991 seconds, 25056 puts/second
0: 0 keys missing
100000 gets, 3.981 seconds, 25118 gets/second
</pre>

<p>
The numbers you see may differ from this sample output by a factor of
two or more, depending on how fast your computer is, whether it has
multiple cores, and whether it's busy doing other things.

<p>
<tt>ph</tt> runs two benchmarks. First it adds lots of keys to the
hash table by calling <tt>put()</tt>, and prints the achieved rate in
puts per second. The it fetches keys from the hash table
with <tt>get()</tt>. It prints the number keys that should have been
in the hash table as a result of the puts but are missing (zero in
this case), and it prints the number of gets per second it achieved.

<p>
You can tell <tt>ph</tt> to use its hash table from multiple
threads at the same time by giving it an argument greater than
one. Try <tt>ph 2</tt>:

<pre>
$ ./ph 2
100000 puts, 1.885 seconds, 53044 puts/second
1: 16579 keys missing
0: 16579 keys missing
200000 gets, 4.322 seconds, 46274 gets/second
</pre>

<pp>
The first line of this <tt>ph 2</tt> output indicates that when two
threads concurrently add entries to the hash table, they
achieve a total rate of 53,044 inserts per second. That's about
twice the rate of the single thread from running
<tt>ph 1</tt>. That's an excellent "parallel speedup" of about 2x,
as much as one could possibly hope for (i.e. twice as many
cores yielding twice as much work per unit time).

<p>
However, the two lines saying <tt>16579 keys missing</tt> indicate that
a large number of keys that should have been in the hash table are not
there. That is, the puts were supposed to add those keys to the hash
table, but something went wrong.
Have a look at <tt>notxv6/ph.c</tt>, particularly at <tt>put()</tt>
and <tt>insert()</tt>.

<div class="question">
Why are there missing keys
with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread?  Identify a sequence of
events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.
Submit your sequence with a short explanation in answers-thread.txt
</div>

<div class="required">

<p>To avoid this sequence of events, insert lock and unlock statements
in
<tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> in <tt>notxv6/ph.c</tt> so that the
number of keys missing is always 0 with two threads. The relevant
pthread calls are:

<pre>
pthread_mutex_t lock;            // declare a lock
pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL); // initialize the lock
pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);       // acquire lock
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);     // release lock
</pre>

<p>
You're done when <tt>make grade</tt> says that your code passes the <tt>ph_safe</tt> test,
which requires zero missing keys with two threads.
It's OK at this point to fail the <tt>ph_fast</tt> test.
</div>

<p>
Don't forget to call <tt>pthread_mutex_init()</tt>.
Test your code first with 1 thread, then test it with 2 threads.
Is it correct (i.e. have you eliminated missing keys?)?  Does the
two-threaded version achieve parallel speedup (i.e. more total
work per unit time) relative
to the single-threaded version?

<p>
There are situations where concurrent <tt>put()</tt>s
have no overlap in the memory they read or write in the
hash table, and thus don't need a lock to protect against
each other.
Can you change <tt>ph.c</tt> to take advantage of such situations to obtain parallel
speedup for some <tt>put()</tt>s?
Hint: how about a lock per hash bucket?

<div class="required">
<p>Modify your code so that some <tt>put</tt> operations run in parallel
  while maintaining correctness.
You're done when <tt>make grade</tt> says your code passes
both the <tt>ph_safe</tt> and <tt>ph_fast</tt> tests.
The <tt>ph_fast</tt> test requires that two threads yield at least 1.25 times as
many puts/second as one thread.
</div>

<h2>Barrier<script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this assignment you'll implement a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)">barrier</a>:
a point in an
application at which all participating threads must wait until all other participating threads reach
that point too. You'll use pthread condition variables, which are a sequence
coordination technique similar to xv6's sleep and wakeup.

<p>You should do this assignment on a real computer (not xv6, not qemu).

<p>The file <tt>notxv6/barrier.c</tt> contains a broken barrier.
<pre>
$ make barrier
$ ./barrier 2
barrier: notxv6/barrier.c:42: thread: Assertion `i == t' failed.
</pre>

The 2 specifies the number of threads that synchronize on the barrier (
<tt>nthread</tt> in <tt>barrier.c</tt>).  Each thread executes a loop. In
each loop iteration a thread calls <tt>barrier()</tt> and then sleeps for a
random number of microseconds. The assert triggers, because one thread leaves the
barrier before the other thread has reached the barrier.  The desired behavior is
that each thread blocks in <tt>barrier()</tt> until all <tt>nthreads</tt> of them have called
<tt>barrier()</tt>.

<div class="required">
<p>Your goal is to achieve the desired barrier behavior. In addition to the
 lock primitives that you have seen in the <tt>ph</tt> assignment, you will need
 the following new pthread primitives;
look
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_cond_wait.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_cond_broadcast.html">here</a>
for details.

<pre>
pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);  // go to sleep on cond, releasing lock mutex, acquiring upon wake up
pthread_cond_broadcast(&cond);     // wake up every thread sleeping on cond
</pre>

<p>
Make sure your solution passes <tt>make grade</tt>'s <tt>barrier</tt> test.
</div>

<tt>pthread_cond_wait</tt> releases the <tt>mutex</tt> when called,
and re-acquires the <tt>mutex</tt> before returning.

<p>We have given you <tt>barrier_init()</tt>. Your job is to implement
<tt>barrier()</tt> so that the panic doesn't occur.
We've defined <tt>struct barrier</tt> for you; its fields are for
your use.

<p>There are two issues that complicate your task:

<ul>

<li> You have to deal with a succession of barrier calls,
each of which we'll call a round.
  <tt>bstate.round</tt> records the current round.  You
  should increment <tt>bstate.round</tt> each time all
  threads have reached the barrier.

<li> You have to handle the case in which one thread races around the loop before
the others have exited the barrier. In particular, you are re-using
the <tt>bstate.nthread</tt> variable from one round to the next.  Make sure that a thread that
leaves the barrier and races around the loop doesn't increase <tt>bstate.nthread</tt>
while a previous round is still using it.

</ul>

<p>Test your code with one, two, and more than two threads.

<h2>Optional challenges for uthread</h2>

<p>The user-level thread package interacts badly with the operating system in
several ways.  For example, if one user-level thread blocks in a system call,
another user-level thread won't run, because the user-level threads scheduler
doesn't know that one of its threads has been descheduled by the xv6 scheduler.  As
another example, two user-level threads will not run concurrently on different
cores, because the xv6 scheduler isn't aware that there are multiple
threads that could run in parallel.  Note that if two user-level threads were to
run truly in parallel, this implementation won't work because of several races
(e.g., two threads on different processors could call <tt>thread_schedule</tt>
concurrently, select the same runnable thread, and both run it on different
processors.)

<p>There are several ways of addressing these problems.  One is
 using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduler_activations">scheduler
 activations</a> and another is to use one kernel thread per
 user-level thread (as Linux kernels do).  Implement one of these ways
 in xv6.  This is not easy to get right; for example, you will need to
 implement TLB shootdown when updating a page table for a
 multithreaded user process.

<p>Add locks, condition variables, barriers,
etc. to your thread package.
