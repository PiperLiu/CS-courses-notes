<h1>Lab: Copy-on-Write Fork for xv6</h2>

<p> Virtual memory provides a level of indirection: the kernel can
intercept memory references by marking PTEs invalid or read-only,
leading to page faults,
and can change what addresses mean by modifying PTEs.
There is a saying in computer systems that any systems problem can be
solved with a level of indirection.  The lazy allocation lab provided one
example.  This lab explores another example: copy-on write fork.
    
<p>To start the lab, switch to the cow branch:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
$ <kbd>git checkout cow</kbd>
$ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
</pre>

<h2>The problem</h2>

The fork() system call in xv6 copies all of the parent process's
user-space memory into the child. If the parent is large, copying can
take a long time. Worse, the work is often largely wasted; for example,
a fork() followed by exec() in the child will cause the child to
discard the copied memory, probably without ever using most of it.
On the other hand, if both parent and child use a page, and one or both
writes it, a copy is truly needed.

<h2>The solution</h2>

The goal of copy-on-write (COW) fork() is to defer allocating and
copying physical memory pages for the child until the copies are actually
needed, if ever.

<p>
COW fork() creates just a pagetable for the child, with PTEs for user
memory pointing to the parent's physical pages. COW fork() marks all
the user PTEs in both parent and child as not writable. When either
process tries to write one of these COW pages, the CPU will force a
page fault. The kernel page-fault handler detects this case, allocates
a page of physical memory for the faulting process, copies the
original page into the new page, and modifies the relevant PTE in the
faulting process to refer to the new page, this time with the PTE
marked writeable. When the page fault handler returns, the user
process will be able to write its copy of the page.

<p>
COW fork() makes freeing of the physical pages that implement user
memory a little trickier. A given physical page may be referred to by
multiple processes' page tables, and should be freed only when the last
reference disappears.

<h2>Implement copy-on write<script>g("hard")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
Your task is to implement copy-on-write fork in the xv6 kernel. You are
done if your modified kernel executes both the cowtest and usertests
programs successfully.
</div>

<p>To help you test your implementation, we've provided an xv6 program
called cowtest (source in user/cowtest.c). cowtest runs various tests, but
even the first will fail on unmodified xv6. Thus, initially, you
will see:

<pre>
$ <kbd>cowtest</kbd>
simple: fork() failed
$ 
</pre>

The "simple" test allocates more than half of available physical
memory, and then fork()s. The fork fails because there is not enough
free physical memory to give the child a complete copy of the parent's memory.

<p>
When you are done, your kernel should pass all the tests in both cowtest and
usertests. That is:

<pre>
$ <kbd>cowtest</kbd>
simple: ok
simple: ok
three: zombie!
ok
three: zombie!
ok
three: zombie!
ok
file: ok
ALL COW TESTS PASSED
$ <kbd>usertests</kbd>
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$
</pre>

<p>
Here's a reasonable plan of attack.

<ol>

<li> Modify uvmcopy() to map the parent's physical pages into the
child, instead of allocating new pages. Clear <tt>PTE_W</tt> in the PTEs of
both child and parent.

<li> Modify usertrap() to recognize page faults. When a page-fault
occurs on a COW page, allocate a new page with kalloc(), copy the old
page to the new page, and install the new page in the PTE with <tt>PTE_W</tt>
set.

<li> Ensure that each physical page is freed when the last PTE
reference to it goes away -- but not before.
A good way to do this is to keep, for each physical page, a "reference count"
of the number of user page tables that refer to that page.
Set a page's reference count to one when <tt>kalloc()</tt> allocates it.
Increment a page's reference count
when fork causes a child to share the page, and
decrement a page's count each time any process drops
the page from its page table.
<tt>kfree()</tt> should only place a page back on the free list
if its reference count is zero.
It's OK to to keep these counts in a fixed-size array of integers.
You'll have to work out a scheme for how to index the array and
how to choose its size. For example, you could index the array
with the page's physical address divided by 4096, and give
the array a number of elements equal to highest physical
address of any page placed on the free list by <tt>kinit()</tt> in
kalloc.c.

<li> Modify copyout() to use the
same scheme as page faults when it encounters a COW page.

</ol>

<p>Some hints:

  <ul>
    
<li>The lazy page allocation lab has likely made you familiar with much of
the xv6 kernel code that's relevant for copy-on-write. However, you
should not base this lab on your lazy allocation solution; instead,
please start with a fresh copy of xv6 as directed above.

<li>
It may be useful to have a way to record, for each PTE, whether it is
a COW mapping. You can use the RSW (reserved for software) bits in
the RISC-V PTE for this.

<li>
<tt>usertests</tt> explores scenarios that <tt>cowtest</tt> does not test,
so don't forget to check that all tests pass for both.

<li>Some helpful macros and definitions for page table flags are at the
end of <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>.

<li>If a COW page fault occurs and there's no free memory, the process
should be killed.

  </ul>

<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> Make sure you pass all of the make
grade tests. If this lab had questions, don't forget to write up your
answers to the questions in answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt. Commit your changes
(including adding answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt) and type make handin in the lab
  directory to hand in your lab.

<h3>Time spent</h3>

<p>Create a new file, <tt>time.txt</tt>, and put in it a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab. Don't forget to <tt>git add</tt> and
<tt>git commit</tt> the file.

<h3>Submit</h3>

You will turn in your assignments using
the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">submission
website</a>.  You need to request once an API key from the submission
website before you can turn in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>After committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make
handin</kbd> to submit your lab.

to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">web interface</a>.

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Modify xv6 to support both lazy page allocation and COW.

  <li>Measure how much your COW implementation reduces the number
