<h1>Lab: networking</h1>

<p>In this lab you will write an xv6 device driver for a network interface
card (NIC).

<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>net</tt> branch:

<pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout net</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before writing code, you may find it helpful to review "Chapter 5: Interrupts and
device drivers" in the <a
href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>.
</div>
   
<p>You'll use a network device called the E1000 to handle network
communication. To xv6 (and the driver you write), the E1000 looks like a real
piece of hardware connected to a real Ethernet local area network (LAN). In
fact, the E1000 your driver will talk to is an emulation provided by qemu,
connected to a LAN that is also emulated by qemu. On this emulated LAN, xv6 (the "guest")
has an IP address of 10.0.2.15.
Qemu also arranges for the computer running qemu
to appear on the LAN with
IP address 10.0.2.2.
When xv6 uses the E1000 to send a
packet to 10.0.2.2, qemu delivers the packet to the appropriate application on the
(real) computer on which you're running qemu (the "host").

<p>You will use QEMU's "user-mode network stack".
QEMU's documentation has more about the user-mode
stack
<a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/net.html#using-the-user-mode-network-stack">here</a>.
We've updated the Makefile to enable QEMU's user-mode network stack and the
E1000 network card.

<p>The Makefile configures QEMU to record all incoming and outgoing
packets to the file <tt>packets.pcap</tt> in your lab directory. It may be helpful to review
these recordings to confirm that xv6 is transmitting and receiving the packets you
expect. To display the recorded packets:

<pre>
<kbd>tcpdump -XXnr packets.pcap</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
We've added some files to the xv6 repository for this lab.
The file <tt>kernel/e1000.c</tt> contains initialization
code for the E1000 as well as empty functions for
transmitting and receiving packets, which you'll fill in.
<tt>kernel/e1000_dev.h</tt> contains definitions for
registers and flag bits defined by the E1000 and
described in the Intel E1000 
<a href="../readings/8254x_GBe_SDM.pdf">Software Developer's Manual</a>.
<tt>kernel/net.c</tt> and <tt>kernel/net.h</tt>
contain a simple network stack that implements the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">ARP</a> protocols.
These files also contain code for a flexible
data structure to hold packets,
called an <tt>mbuf</tt>.
Finally, <tt>kernel/pci.c</tt> contains code that 
searches for an E1000 card on the PCI bus when xv6 boots.

<h2>Your Job <script>g("hard")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Your job is to complete
<tt>e1000_transmit()</tt> and
<tt>e1000_recv()</tt>,
both in <tt>kernel/e1000.c</tt>,
so that the driver can transmit and receive packets.
You are done when <tt>make grade</tt> says your
solution passes all the tests.
</div>
<div class="prereq">
  <p>While writing your code, you'll find yourself referring to the E1000 <a href="../readings/8254x_GBe_SDM.pdf">Software Developer's Manual</a>. Of particular help may be the following sections:
    <ul>
      <li>Section 2 is essential and gives an overview of the entire device.</li>
      <li>Section 3.2 gives an overview of packet receiving.</li>
      <li>Section 3.3 gives an overview of packet transmission, alongside section 3.4.</li>
      <li>Section 13 gives an overview of the registers used by the E1000.</li>
      <li>Section 14 may help you understand the init code that we've provided.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<p>Browse the E1000 <a
href="../readings/8254x_GBe_SDM.pdf">Software Developer's Manual</a>.
This manual covers several closely related Ethernet controllers.
QEMU emulates the 82540EM. Skim Chapter 2 now to get a feel for
the device.  To write your driver, you'll need to be familiar with Chapters 3
and 14, as well as 4.1 (though not 4.1's subsections).  You'll also need to use
Chapter 13 as a reference.  The other chapters mostly cover components of the
E1000 that your driver won't have to interact with.  Don't worry about the
details at first; just get a feel for how the document is structured so you can
find things later. The E1000 has many advanced features,
most of which you can ignore. Only a small set of basic features is needed to
complete this lab.

<p>
The <tt>e1000_init()</tt> function we provide you in <tt>e1000.c</tt>
configures the E1000 to read packets to be transmitted from RAM, and
to write received packets to RAM. This technique is called DMA, for
direct memory access, referring to the fact that the E1000 hardware
directly writes and reads packets to/from RAM.

<p>
Because bursts of packets might arrive faster than the driver can process
them, <tt>e1000_init()</tt> provides the E1000 with multiple buffers into
which the E1000 can write packets. The E1000 requires these
buffers to be described by an array of "descriptors" in RAM; each
descriptor contains an address in RAM where the E1000 can
write a received packet.
<tt>struct
rx_desc</tt> describes the descriptor format.
The array of descriptors is called the
receive ring, or receive queue. It's a circular ring in the sense that
when the card or driver reaches the end of the array, it wraps back to
the beginning. <tt>e1000_init()</tt> allocates <tt>mbuf</tt> packet buffers 
for the E1000 to DMA into, using <tt>mbufalloc()</tt>.
There is also a transmit ring
into which the driver places packets it wants the E1000 to send.
<tt>e1000_init()</tt> configures the two rings to have size
<tt>RX_RING_SIZE</tt> and <tt>TX_RING_SIZE</tt>.

<p>
When the network stack in <tt>net.c</tt> needs to send a packet,
it calls <tt>e1000_transmit()</tt> with an
mbuf that holds the packet to be sent.
Your transmit code must place a pointer to the packet data
in a descriptor in the TX (transmit) ring.
<tt>struct
tx_desc</tt> describes the descriptor format. You will need to ensure that each
mbuf is eventually freed, but only after the E1000 has finished
transmitting the packet (the E1000
sets the <tt>E1000_TXD_STAT_DD</tt> bit in the descriptor to indicate this).

<p>
When the E1000 receives each packet from the ethernet, it first DMAs
the packet to the mbuf pointed to by the next RX (receive) ring descriptor, and then
generates an interrupt. Your <tt>e1000_recv()</tt> code must scan the RX ring and
deliver each new packet's mbuf to the network stack (in <tt>net.c</tt>) by
calling <tt>net_rx()</tt>. You will then need to allocate a new mbuf
and place it into the descriptor, so that when the E1000 reaches
that point in the RX ring again it finds a fresh buffer into which to DMA a new
packet.

<p>In addition to reading and writing the descriptor rings in RAM,
your driver will
need to interact with the E1000 through its memory-mapped control registers,
to detect when
received packets are available and
to inform the E1000 that
the driver has filled in some TX descriptors with packets to send.
The global variable <tt>regs</tt> holds a
pointer to the
E1000's first control register;
your driver can get at the other registers by indexing <tt>regs</tt>
as an array.
You'll need to use indices <tt>E1000_RDT</tt> and
<tt>E1000_TDT</tt> in particular.

<p>
To test your driver,
run <tt>make server</tt> in one window,
and in another window run <tt>make qemu</tt>
and then run <tt>nettests</tt> in xv6.
The first test in <tt>nettests</tt> tries to send a UDP packet to the
host operating system, addressed to the program
that <tt>make server</tt> runs.
If you haven't completed the lab, the E1000 driver
won't actually send the packet, and nothing much
will happen.

<p>After you've completed the lab, the
E1000 driver will send the packet,
qemu will deliver it to your host computer, <tt>make server</tt>
will see it, it will send a response packet, and
the E1000 driver and then
<tt>nettests</tt> will see the response packet.
Before the host sends the reply, however, it sends an
"ARP" request packet to xv6 to find out its
48-bit Ethernet address, and expects xv6 to respond with
an ARP reply. <tt>kernel/net.c</tt> will take care of this
once you have finished your work on the E1000 driver.
If all goes well, <tt>nettests</tt> will print <tt>testing ping: OK</tt>,
and <tt>make server</tt> will print <tt>a message from xv6!</tt>.

<p>
<kbd>tcpdump -XXnr packets.pcap</kbd> should produce output that
starts like this:

<p>
Your output will look somewhat different, but it should contain
the strings "ARP, Request", "ARP, Reply", "UDP", "a.message.from.xv6"
and "this.is.the.host".

<p>
<tt>nettests</tt> performs some other tests, culminating in a
DNS request sent over the (real) Internet to one of Google's
name server. You should ensure that your code passes all these
tests, after which you should see this output:

<pre>
$ nettests
nettests running on port 25603

testing single-process pings: OK
testing multi-process pings: OK
testing DNS

DNS OK
all tests passed.
</pre>

<p>
You should ensure that
<tt>make grade</tt> agrees that your solution passes.

<h2>Hints</h2>

Start by adding print statements to <tt>e1000_transmit()</tt>
and <tt>e1000_recv()</tt>, and running <tt>make server</tt> and (in
xv6) <tt>nettests</tt>. You should see from your print statements
that <tt>nettests</tt> generates a call to <tt>e1000_transmit</tt>.

<p>Some hints for implementing <tt>e1000_transmit</tt>:

<ul>

<li>First ask the E1000 for the TX ring index
at which it's expecting the next packet, by reading the
<tt>E1000_TDT</tt> control register.

<li> Then check if the the ring is overflowing. If <tt>E1000_TXD_STAT_DD</tt> is
not set in the descriptor indexed by <tt>E1000_TDT</tt>,
the E1000 hasn't finished the corresponding previous transmission
request, so return an error.

<li> Otherwise, use <tt>mbuffree()</tt> to free the last mbuf that was
transmitted from that descriptor (if there was one).

<li> Then fill in the descriptor. <tt>m->head</tt> points to the
packet's content in memory, and <tt>m->len</tt> is the packet length.
Set the necessary cmd flags (look at Section 3.3 in the E1000 manual) and stash away a
pointer to the mbuf for later freeing.

<li> Finally, update the ring position by adding one to <tt>E1000_TDT</tt>
  modulo <tt>TX_RING_SIZE</tt>.

<li> If <tt>e1000_transmit()</tt> added the mbuf successfully to the ring, return 0.
  On failure (e.g., there
  is no descriptor available to transmit the mbuf), return -1 so that
  the caller knows to free the mbuf.
  
</ul>

<p>Some hints for implementing <tt>e1000_recv</tt>:

<ul>
    
<li> First ask the E1000 for the ring index at which the next waiting
received packet (if any) is located, by fetching the <tt>E1000_RDT</tt>
control register and adding
one modulo <tt>RX_RING_SIZE</tt>.

<li> Then check if a new packet is available by checking for the
<tt>E1000_RXD_STAT_DD</tt> bit in the <tt>status</tt> portion of the descriptor.
If not, stop.

<li> Otherwise, update the mbuf's <tt>m->len</tt> to the length reported in the
  descriptor.  Deliver the mbuf to the
  network stack using <tt>net_rx()</tt>.
 
<li> Then allocate a new mbuf using <tt>mbufalloc()</tt> to replace the one just given to <tt>net_rx()</tt>.
   Program its data pointer (<tt>m->head</tt>) into the
descriptor.  Clear the descriptor's status bits to zero.

<li> Finally, update the <tt>E1000_RDT</tt> register to be the index
of the last ring descriptor processed.

<li><tt>e1000_init()</tt> initializes the RX ring with mbufs,
and you'll want to look at how it does that and perhaps borrow code.

<li>
At some point the total number of packets that have ever
arrived will exceed the ring size (16); make sure your
code can handle that.

</ul>

<p>You'll need locks to cope with the possibility that xv6 might
use the E1000 from more than one process, or might be using the E1000
in a kernel thread when an interrupt arrives.

<h2>Optional Challenges:</h2>

<p> Some of the benefits of the challenge exercises below are only
measurable/testable on real, high-performance hardware, which means
x86-based computers.
  
<ul>
  
<li> In this lab, the networking stack uses interrupts to handle ingress packet
processing, but not egress packet processing. A more sophisticated strategy
would be to queue egress packets in software and only provide a limited number
to the NIC at any one time. You can then rely on TX interrupts to refill the
transmit ring. Using this technique, it becomes possible to prioritize
  different types of egress traffic. <script>g("easy")</script>
  
<li> The provided networking code only partially supports ARP. Implement a full
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826">ARP cache</a> and wire it in to
<tt>net_tx_eth()</tt>. <script>g("moderate")</script>

<li> The E1000 supports multiple RX and TX rings. Configure the E1000 to
provide a ring pair for each core and modify your networking stack to support
multiple rings. Doing so has the potential to increase the throughput that
your networking stack can support as well as reduce lock contention.
<script>g("moderate")</script>, but difficult to test/measure
  
<li> <tt>sockrecvudp()</tt> uses a singly-linked list to find the destination
  socket, which is inefficient. Try using a hash
  table and RCU instead to increase performance.
  <script>g("easy")</script>, but a serious implementation would difficult to test/measure
  
<li> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> can provide
notifications of failed networking flows. Detect these notifications and
  propagate them as errors through the socket system call interface.
  
<li> The E1000 supports several stateless hardware offloads, including
checksum calculation, RSC, and GRO. Use one or more of these offloads
to increase the throughput of your networking
stack.  <script>g("moderate")</script>, but hard to test/measure

<li> The networking stack in this lab is susceptible to receive livelock. Using
the material in lecture and the reading assignment, devise and implement a
  solution to fix it.   <script>g("moderate")</script>, but hard to test.

<li> Implement a UDP server for xv6.  <script>g("moderate")</script>
  
<li> Implement a minimal TCP stack and download a web
  page. <script>g("hard")</script>
  
</ul>

<p> If you pursue a challenge problem, whether it is related to networking or
  not, please let the course staff know!
