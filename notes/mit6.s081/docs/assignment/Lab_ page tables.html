<h1>Lab: page tables</h1>

<p> In this lab you will explore page tables and modify them to
  simplify the functions that copy data from user space to kernel space.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 3 of
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related files:

  <ul>
   <li> <tt>kern/memlayout.h</tt>, which captures the layout of memory.
	  
    <li> <tt>kern/vm.c</tt>, which contains most virtual memory (VM) code.

    <li> <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>, which contains code for allocating and
    freeing physical memory.
  
  </ul>

</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the pgtbl branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout pgtbl</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>
 
<h2>Print a page table <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
To help you learn about RISC-V page tables, and perhaps
to aid future debugging, your first task is to write a function
that prints
  the contents of a page table.

<div class="required">
Define a function called <tt>vmprint()</tt>.
It should take
a <tt>pagetable_t</tt> argument, and print that pagetable
in the format described below.
Insert <tt>if(p->pid==1) vmprint(p->pagetable)</tt> in
  exec.c just before the <tt>return argc</tt>,
to print the first process's page table.
  You receive full credit for this
  assignment if you pass the <tt>pte printout</tt> test of <tt>make grade</tt>.
  
</div>

<p>
Now when you start xv6 it should print output like this, describing
the page table of the first process at the point when it has just
finished <tt>exec()</tt>ing <tt>init</tt>:

  <pre>
page table 0x0000000087f6e000
..0: pte 0x0000000021fda801 pa 0x0000000087f6a000
.. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fda401 pa 0x0000000087f69000
.. .. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fdac1f pa 0x0000000087f6b000
.. .. ..1: pte 0x0000000021fda00f pa 0x0000000087f68000
.. .. ..2: pte 0x0000000021fd9c1f pa 0x0000000087f67000
..255: pte 0x0000000021fdb401 pa 0x0000000087f6d000
.. ..511: pte 0x0000000021fdb001 pa 0x0000000087f6c000
.. .. ..510: pte 0x0000000021fdd807 pa 0x0000000087f76000
.. .. ..511: pte 0x0000000020001c0b pa 0x0000000080007000
  </pre>

The first line displays the argument to <tt>vmprint</tt>.
After that there is a line for each PTE, including PTEs that
refer to page-table pages deeper in the tree.
Each PTE line is indented by a number of <tt>" .."</tt> that indicates its
depth in the tree.
Each PTE line shows the PTE index in its page-table page, the pte bits, and the
physical address extracted from the PTE.
Don't print PTEs that are not valid.  In the above example, the
top-level page-table page has mappings for entries 0 and 255.  The next
level down for entry 0 has only index 0 mapped, and the bottom-level
for that index 0 has entries 0, 1, and 2 mapped.

<p>
Your code might emit different physical addresses than those shown above.
The number of entries and the virtual addresses should be the same.
</p>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>You can put <tt>vmprint()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>.
  <li>Use the macros at the end of the file kernel/riscv.h.
  <li>The function <tt>freewalk</tt> may be inspirational.
  <li>Define the prototype for <tt>vmprint</tt> in kernel/defs.h so
    that you can call it from exec.c.
  <li>Use <tt>%p</tt> in your printf calls to print out full 64-bit hex PTEs and addresses as shown in the example.</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
Explain the output of <tt>vmprint</tt> in terms of Fig 3-4 from the
text.  What does page 0 contain? What is in page 2?
When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory
mapped by page 1?
</div>

<h2>A kernel page table per process <script>g("hard")</script></h2>

<p>
Xv6 has a single kernel page table that's used whenever it executes
in the kernel.
The kernel page
table is a direct mapping to physical addresses, so that kernel
virtual address <i>x</i> maps to physical address <i>x</i>. 
Xv6 also has a separate page table for each process's user
address space, containing only mappings for that
process's user memory, starting at virtual address zero.
Because the kernel page table doesn't contain these
mappings, user addresses are not valid in the kernel.
Thus, when the kernel
needs to use a user pointer passed in a system call (e.g., the buffer
pointer passed to <tt>write()</tt>), the kernel must first translate
the pointer to a physical address.
The goal of this section and the next is to allow the kernel to
directly dereference user pointers.

  <div class="required">
Your first job is to modify the kernel so that every process
uses its own copy of the kernel page table when executing
in the kernel.
Modify <tt>struct proc</tt> to maintain
a kernel page table for each process, and modify
the scheduler to switch kernel page tables when switching
processes. For this step, each per-process kernel page table
should be identical to the existing global kernel page table.
You pass this part of the lab if <tt>usertests</tt> runs correctly.
</div>

 <p>Read the book chapter and code mentioned at the start of this
   assignment; it will be easier to modify the virtual memory
   code correctly with an understanding of how it works.
   Bugs in page table setup can cause traps
   due to missing mappings, can
   cause loads and stores to affect unexpected pages
   of physical memory, and can cause execution of instructions from
   incorrect pages of memory.

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>

  <li>Add a field to <tt>struct proc</tt> for the process's kernel
  page table.

  <li>A reasonable way to produce a kernel page table for a new process
  is to implement a modified version of <tt>kvminit</tt> that makes
  a new page table instead of modifying <tt>kernel_pagetable</tt>.
  You'll want to call this function from <tt>allocproc</tt>.

  <li>Make sure that each process's kernel page table has a mapping
  for that process's kernel stack. In unmodified xv6, all the
  kernel stacks are set up in <tt>procinit</tt>. You will need to
  move some or all of this functionality to <tt>allocproc</tt>.

  <li>Modify <tt>scheduler()</tt> to load the process's kernel page table into
  the core's <tt>satp</tt> register (see <tt>kvminithart</tt> for
  inspiration). Don't forget to call <tt>sfence_vma()</tt>
  after calling <tt>w_satp()</tt>.

  <li><tt>scheduler()</tt> should use <tt>kernel_pagetable</tt> when
  no process is running.

  <li>Free a process's kernel page table in <tt>freeproc</tt>.

  <li>You'll need a way to free a page table without also
    freeing the leaf physical memory pages.

  <li><tt>vmprint</tt> may come in handy to debug page tables.

  <li>It's OK to modify xv6 functions or add new functions; you'll
      probably need to do this in at least <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>
      and <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>. (But, don't
    modify <tt>kernel/vmcopyin.c</tt>, <tt>kernel/stats.c</tt>,
    <tt>user/usertests.c</tt>, and <tt>user/stats.c</tt>.)

  <li>A missing page table mapping will likely cause the kernel
      to encounter a page fault. It will print
      an error that includes <tt>sepc=0x00000000XXXXXXXX</tt>. You can find
      out where the fault occurred by searching for <tt>XXXXXXXX</tt>
      in <tt>kernel/kernel.asm</tt>.

</ul>

<h2>Simplify <tt>copyin/copyinstr</tt> <script>g("hard")</script></h2>

The kernel's 
<tt>copyin</tt> function reads memory pointed to by user
pointers. It does this by translating them to physical addresses,
which the kernel can directly dereference. It performs this
translation by walking the process page-table in software. Your job in
this part of the lab is to add user mappings to each process's
kernel page table (created in the previous section) that allow
<tt>copyin</tt> (and the related string function
<tt>copyinstr</tt>) to directly dereference user pointers.

  <div class="required">
    Replace the body of <tt>copyin</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>
      with a call to <tt>copyin_new</tt> (defined in
      <tt>kernel/vmcopyin.c</tt>); do the same
for <tt>copyinstr</tt> and <tt>copyinstr_new</tt>.
    Add mappings for user addresses to
each process's kernel page table so that 
<tt>copyin_new</tt> and <tt>copyinstr_new</tt> work.
 You pass this assignment if <tt>usertests</tt> runs correctly
and all the <tt>make grade</tt> tests pass.
</div>

<p>
This scheme relies on the user virtual address range not overlapping
the range of virtual addresses that the kernel uses for its own instructions
and data. Xv6 uses virtual addresses that start at zero for
user address spaces, and luckily the kernel's memory starts at higher
addresses.
However, 
this scheme does limit the maximum size of a user process to be less than
the kernel's lowest virtual address.  After the kernel has
booted, that address is <tt>0xC000000</tt> in xv6, the address of
the PLIC registers;
see <tt>kvminit()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>,
<tt>kernel/memlayout.h</tt>, and Figure 3-4 in the text. You'll need to modify xv6 to prevent user processes from
growing larger than the PLIC address.

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>

    <li>Replace <tt>copyin()</tt> 
      with a call to <tt>copyin_new</tt> first,
      and make it work, before moving on to <tt>copyinstr</tt>.

    <li>At each point where the kernel changes a process's user
    mappings, change the process's kernel page table in the same way.
    Such points include <tt>fork()</tt>, <tt>exec()</tt>,
      and <tt>sbrk()</tt>.

    <li>Don't forget that to include the first process's user page
      table in its kernel page table in <tt>userinit</tt>.
      
    <li>What permissions do the PTEs for user addresses need
    in a process's kernel page table?  (A page
    with <tt>PTE_U</tt> set cannot be accessed in kernel mode.)

    <li>Don't forget about the above-mentioned PLIC limit.
      
</ul>


<p>
  Linux uses a technique similar to what you have implemented.
  Until a few years ago many kernels used the same per-process
  page table in both user and kernel space, with mappings for
  both user and kernel addresses, to avoid having to switch
  page tables when switching between user and kernel space.
  However, that setup allowed
  side-channel attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre.

  <div class="question">
    
<p>Explain why the third test <tt>srcva + len < srcva</tt> is
necessary in <tt>copyin_new()</tt>:
give values for <tt>srcva</tt> and <tt>len</tt> for which 
the first two test fail (i.e., they will not cause to return -1) but for which the third
						one is true (resulting
						in returning -1).

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Use super-pages to reduce the number of PTEs in page tables.

  <li>Extend your solution to support user programs that are as large
  as possible; that is, eliminate the restriction that user
  programs be smaller than PLIC.

  <li>Unmap the first page of a user process so that dereferencing a
  null pointer will result in a fault.  You will have to start the
  user text segment at, for example, 4096, instead of 0.
