<h1>Lab: system calls</h1>

<p>In the last lab you used systems calls to write a few utilities. In
this lab you will add some new system calls to xv6, which will help
you understand how they work and will expose you to some of the
internals of the xv6 kernel.  You will add more system calls in later
labs.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 2 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
    Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4, and
  related source files:
  
  <ul>
    
    <li> The user-space code for systems calls is
      in <tt>user/user.h</tt> and <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>.</li>
    
    <li> The kernel-space code
    is <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>, </tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>.

    <li> The process-related code is <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt> and <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.
  
  </ul>
</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the syscall branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout syscall</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>

<p>If you run, make grade, you will see that the grading script cannot
exec
  <tt>trace</tt> and <tt>sysinfotest</tt>.  Your job is to add the
  necessary system calls and stubs to make them work.
  
<h2>System call tracing <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that
  may help you when debugging later labs.  You'll create a
  new <tt>trace</tt> system call that will control tracing. It should
  take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which
  system calls to trace.  For example, to trace the fork system call,
  a program calls <tt>trace(1 << SYS_fork)</tt>, where <tt>SYS_fork</tt> is a
  syscall number from <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. You have to modify
  the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to
  return, if the system call's number is set in the mask.
  The line should contain the
  process id, the name of the system call and the
  return value; you don't need to print the system call
  arguments. The <tt>trace</tt> system call should enable tracing 
  for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks,
  but should not affect other processes.
</div>

<p>We provide a <tt>trace</tt> user-level program that runs another
  program with tracing enabled (see <tt>user/trace.c</tt>). When you're
  done, you should see output like this:

<pre>
$ trace 32 grep hello README
3: syscall read -> 1023
3: syscall read -> 966
3: syscall read -> 70
3: syscall read -> 0
$
$ trace 2147483647 grep hello README
4: syscall trace -> 0
4: syscall exec -> 3
4: syscall open -> 3
4: syscall read -> 1023
4: syscall read -> 966
4: syscall read -> 70
4: syscall read -> 0
4: syscall close -> 0
$
$ grep hello README
$
$ trace 2 usertests forkforkfork
usertests starting
test forkforkfork: 407: syscall fork -> 408
408: syscall fork -> 409
409: syscall fork -> 410
410: syscall fork -> 411
409: syscall fork -> 412
410: syscall fork -> 413
409: syscall fork -> 414
411: syscall fork -> 415
...
$   
</pre>

<p>In the first example above, trace invokes grep tracing just the
read system call. The 32 is <tt>1&lt;&lt;SYS_read</tt>. In the second
example, trace runs grep while tracing all system calls; the
2147583647 has all 31 low bits set. In the third example, the program
isn't traced, so no trace output is printed. In the fourth example,
the fork system calls of all the descendants of the <tt>forkforkfork</tt> test
in <tt>usertests</tt> are being traced. Your solution is correct if your
program behaves as shown above (though the process IDs may be
different).

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>

    <li><p>Add <tt>$U/_trace</tt> to UPROGS in Makefile

    <li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd> and you will see that the
	compiler cannot compile <tt>user/trace.c</tt>, because the
	user-space stubs for the system call don't exist yet: add a
	prototype for the system call to <tt>user/user.h</tt>, a stub
	to <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, and a syscall number
	to <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>.  The Makefile invokes the perl
	script <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, which produces <tt>user/usys.S</tt>, 
	the actual system call stubs, which use the
	RISC-V <tt>ecall</tt> instruction to transition to the
	kernel. Once you fix the compilation issues, 
	run <kbd>trace 32 grep hello README</kbd>; it will fail
	because you haven't implemented the system call in the kernel
	yet.
    
    <li><p>Add a <tt>sys_trace()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> that implements the new system
	call by remembering its argument in a new variable in
	the <tt>proc</tt> structure (see <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt>). The
	functions to retrieve system call arguments from user space are
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>, and you can see examples
        of their use in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
   </li>

    <li><p>Modify <tt>fork()</tt> (see <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>) to copy
    the trace mask from the parent to the child process. </li>

    <li><p>Modify the <tt>syscall()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> to print the trace output. You will need to add an array of syscall names to index into.</li>

  </ul>

<h2>Sysinfo <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  In this assignment you will add a system call, <tt>sysinfo</tt>,
  that collects information about the running system.  The system call
  takes one argument: a pointer to a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>
  (see <tt>kernel/sysinfo.h</tt>). The kernel should fill out the
  fields of this struct: the <tt>freemem</tt> field should be set
  to the number of bytes of free memory, and the <tt>nproc</tt>
  field should be set to the number of processes whose <tt>state</tt>
  is not <tt>UNUSED</tt>.
  We provide a test program <tt>sysinfotest</tt>; you pass this
  assignment if it prints "sysinfotest: OK".
</div>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>

<li><p>Add <tt>$U/_sysinfotest</tt> to UPROGS in Makefile
  
<li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd>; <tt>user/sysinfotest.c</tt> will
  fail to compile. Add the system call sysinfo, following the same
  steps as in the previous assignment. To declare the prototype for
  sysinfo() <tt>in user/user.h</tt> you need predeclare the existence
  of <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>:
  <pre>
    struct sysinfo;
    int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *);
  </pre>
Once you fix the compilation issues, run
  <kbd>sysinfotest</kbd>; it will fail because you haven't
  implemented the system call in the kernel yet.
</li>

<li><p>sysinfo needs to copy a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt> back to user
  space; see <tt>sys_fstat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/sysfile.c</tt>)
  and <tt>filestat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/file.c</tt>) for examples of how
  to do that using <tt>copyout()</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>To collect the amount of free memory, add a
  function to <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>
</li>

<li><p>To collect the number of processes, add a
  function to <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> Make sure you pass all of the make
grade tests. If this lab had questions, don't forget to write up your
answers to the questions in answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt. Commit your changes
(including adding answers-<i>lab-name</i>.txt) and type make handin in the lab
  directory to hand in your lab.

<h3>Time spent</h3>

<p>Create a new file, <tt>time.txt</tt>, and put in it a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab. Don't forget to <tt>git add</tt> and
<tt>git commit</tt> the file.

<h3>Submit</h3>

You will turn in your assignments using
the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">submission
website</a>.  You need to request once an API key from the submission
website before you can turn in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>After committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make
handin</kbd> to submit your lab.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -am "ready to submit my lab"</kbd>

<kbd>make handin</kbd> will store your API key in <i>myapi.key</i>. If you need
to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
