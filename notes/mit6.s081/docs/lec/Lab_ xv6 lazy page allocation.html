<h1>Lab: xv6 lazy page allocation</h1>

<p>
One of the many neat tricks an O/S can play with page table hardware
is lazy allocation of user-space heap memory. Xv6 applications ask the
kernel for heap memory using the sbrk() system call. In the kernel
we've given you, sbrk() allocates physical memory and maps it into the
process's virtual address space. It can take a long time for a kernel
to allocate and map memory for a large request. Consider, for example,
that a gigabyte consists of 262,144 4096-byte pages; that's a huge
number of allocations even if each is individually cheap. In addition,
some programs allocate more memory than they actually use (e.g., to
implement sparse arrays), or allocate memory well in advance of use.
To allow sbrk() to complete more quickly in these cases, sophisticated
kernels allocate user memory lazily. That is, sbrk() doesn't allocate
physical memory, but just remembers which user addresses are
allocated and marks those addresses as invalid in the user page table.
When the process first tries to use any given page of
lazily-allocated memory, the CPU generates a page fault, which the
kernel handles by allocating physical memory, zeroing it, and mapping
it. You'll add this lazy allocation feature to xv6 in this lab.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 4 (in particular 4.6) of
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related
  files you are likely to modify:
  <ul>
    <li> <tt>kernel/trap.c</tt>
    <li> <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>
    <li> <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the lazy branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout lazy</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>

  
<h2>Eliminate allocation from sbrk() <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
Your first task is to delete page allocation from the sbrk(n) system
call implementation, which is the function sys_sbrk() in sysproc.c. The
sbrk(n) system call grows the process's memory size by n bytes, and
then returns the start of the newly allocated region (i.e., the old
size). Your new sbrk(n) should just increment the process's size
(myproc()->sz) by n and return the old size. It should not allocate memory
-- so you should delete the call to growproc() (but you still need to
increase the process's size!).
</div>

<p>
Try to guess what the result of this modification will be: what will
break?

<p>
Make this modification, boot xv6, and type <tt>echo hi</tt> to the shell.
You should see something like this:

<pre>
init: starting sh
$ echo hi
usertrap(): unexpected scause 0x000000000000000f pid=3
            sepc=0x0000000000001258 stval=0x0000000000004008
va=0x0000000000004000 pte=0x0000000000000000
panic: uvmunmap: not mapped
</pre>

The "usertrap(): ..." message is from the user trap handler in trap.c;
it has caught an exception that it does not know how to handle. Make
sure you understand why this page fault occurs. The "stval=0x0..04008"
indicates that the virtual address that caused the page fault is
0x4008.

<h2>Lazy allocation <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
Modify the code in trap.c to respond to a page fault from user space
by mapping a newly-allocated page of physical memory at the faulting
address, and then returning back to user space to let the process
continue executing. You should add your code just before
the <tt>printf</tt> call that produced the "usertrap(): ..." message.
Modify whatever other xv6 kernel code you need to in order to
get <tt>echo hi</tt> to work.
</div>

Here are some hints:
 
<ul>

<li>You can check whether a fault is a page fault by seeing if
  r_scause() is 13 or 15 in usertrap().

<li><tt>r_stval()</tt> returns the RISC-V <tt>stval</tt> register,
which contains the virtual
address that caused the page fault.

<li>Steal code from uvmalloc() in vm.c, which is what sbrk()
calls (via growproc()). You'll need to call kalloc() and mappages().

<li>Use PGROUNDDOWN(va) to round the faulting virtual address
down to a page boundary.

<li>uvmunmap() will panic; modify it to not panic if some pages aren't mapped.

<li>If the kernel crashes, look up sepc in kernel/kernel.asm

<li>Use your <tt>vmprint</tt> function from pgtbl lab to print the content of a page table.

<li>If you see the error "incomplete type proc", include "spinlock.h" then "proc.h".

</ul>

<p>
If all goes well, your lazy allocation code should result in <tt>echo
hi</tt> working. You should get at least one page fault (and thus lazy
allocation), and perhaps two.

<h2>Lazytests and Usertests <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>We've supplied you with <tt>lazytests</tt>, an xv6 user program that
tests some specific situations that may stress your lazy memory allocator.
Modify your kernel code so that all of both <tt>lazytests</tt>
and <tt>usertests</tt> pass.

<ul>

  <li> Handle negative sbrk() arguments.

  <li> Kill a process if it page-faults on a virtual memory address
       higher than any allocated with sbrk().

  <li> Handle the parent-to-child memory copy in fork() correctly.

  <li> Handle the case in which a process passes a valid address
       from sbrk()
       to a system call such as read or write, but the memory for
       that address has not yet been allocated.

  <li> Handle out-of-memory correctly: if kalloc() fails in the
page fault handler, kill the current process.

  <li> Handle faults on the invalid page below the user stack.

</ul>

<p>Your solution is acceptable if your kernel passes lazytests and usertests:
<pre>
$ <kbd> lazytests</kbd>
lazytests starting
running test lazy alloc
test lazy alloc: OK
running test lazy unmap...
usertrap(): ...
test lazy unmap: OK
running test out of memory
usertrap(): ...
test out of memory: OK
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ <kbd>usertests</kbd>
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$
</pre>

to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2020/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
