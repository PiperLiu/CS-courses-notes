Q: Why are we reading this paper?

A: Because it is a fun, intriguing read.  This paper was "written" (see
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/) by a 6.824 TAs many years ago, and
assigning it has become a 6.824 tradition. We enjoy reading the answers to the
posted question.  The assignment also has a slightly serious undertone: be
careful with what you read and believe.
